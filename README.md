## ⚡ Fun Fact

I discovered my passion for programming at the age of 10 while playing Little Big Planet. The game's level creation system, which allowed players to "code" NPC brains using a simple block-like algorithm system, sparked my curiosity. After hearing the term "algorithm" in a tutorial, I researched it online and stumbled upon the Ruby on Rails documentation. From that moment on, I began coding using the documentation, igniting a lifelong passion for programming.
